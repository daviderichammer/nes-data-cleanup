# NES Data Cleanup - Todo List

## Phase 1: Discovery and Safety
- [x] Create full database backup procedure
- [x] Map all foreign key constraints
- [x] Identify implicit relationships in EAV model
- [x] Document deletion order dependencies

## Phase 2: ID Cutoff Identification (REVISED APPROACH)
- [x] Create SQL scripts to identify ID cutoffs
- [x] Implement Python script for cutoff identification
- [x] Add safety validation for cutoffs
- [x] Create comprehensive cutoff reporting

## Phase 3: Batch Deletion Implementation
- [x] Design batch deletion strategy using ID ranges
- [x] Implement Python batch deletion framework
- [x] Add transaction control and error handling
- [x] Create deletion logging infrastructure
- [x] Implement resumable deletion process

## Phase 4: Scripting and Automation
- [x] Create Python script framework
- [x] Implement configuration management
- [x] Add comprehensive logging
- [x] Implement dry-run mode
- [x] Add safety thresholds and validation
- [x] Create orchestration shell script
- [x] Add progress monitoring and reporting

## Testing and Validation
- [ ] Unit tests for identification logic
- [ ] Integration tests on database copy
- [ ] Safety threshold testing
- [ ] Dry-run validation
- [ ] Performance testing

## Deployment
- [ ] Production dry-run cycles
- [ ] Gradual rollout with small batches
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting setup
- [ ] Documentation for operations team

## Completed
- [x] Create comprehensive data deletion plan
- [x] Set up GitHub repository
- [x] Initial project documentation


## Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test cutoff identification on production database (read-only)
- [ ] Validate batch deletion logic on database copy
- [ ] Test resumption capability after interruption
- [ ] Performance testing with different batch sizes
- [ ] Validate safety thresholds and error handling

## Production Deployment
- [ ] Run cutoff identification on production
- [ ] Perform comprehensive dry-run validation
- [ ] Start with small batch sizes on non-critical tables
- [ ] Monitor system performance impact during deletion
- [ ] Validate database size reduction and space reclamation

## Documentation and Handover
- [ ] Create operational runbook
- [ ] Document troubleshooting procedures
- [ ] Create monitoring and alerting setup
- [ ] Train operations team on script usage

## Completed Major Milestones
- [x] âœ… **MAJOR REVISION**: Switched from staging tables to ID-based deletion approach
- [x] âœ… Created comprehensive revised plan for massive scale datasets
- [x] âœ… Implemented complete cutoff identification system
- [x] âœ… Built robust batch deletion framework with safety features
- [x] âœ… Added resumable processing and comprehensive logging
- [x] âœ… Created user-friendly orchestration scripts
- [x] âœ… **CONTACT TYPE FIX**: Fixed community identification logic to use flexible pattern matching instead of hardcoded 'zy' type
- [x] âœ… **FINAL COMMUNITY LOGIC**: Updated to use actual contact types (Client/Prospect/Closed) and ZY name prefix without LIKE operators for performance
- [x] âœ… **FOREIGN KEY ANALYSIS**: Completed comprehensive analysis of explicit and implicit EAV relationships
- [x] âœ… **DELETION ORDER STRATEGY**: Created proper dependency management and polymorphic cascade deletion logic
- [x] âœ… **DISCOVERY ANALYSIS**: Analyzed actual polymorphic relationships and volumes from production database
- [x] âœ… **PRODUCTION BATCH DELETER**: Created volume-optimized deletion strategy based on real data (67M+ addresses, 5.9M+ phones, etc.)
- [x] âœ… **VPN SERVER INSTALLATION GUIDE**: Created comprehensive installation and run guide for VPN server deployment

## Next Steps - PRODUCTION READY! ðŸš€
1. **âœ… COMPLETED: Discovery Analysis** - Mapped all polymorphic relationships and actual volumes
2. **ðŸ”¥ THIS WEEK: Test Cutoff Identification**: Run cutoff identification to get actual numbers and validate logic
3. **ðŸ“‹ NEXT WEEK: Production Pilot - Phase 1**: Start with community cleanup (36K records, safest)
4. **ðŸš€ FOLLOWING WEEKS: Phase 2 & 3**: Reading cleanup (200M+ records) then tenant cleanup (11.8M records)
5. **ðŸ“ˆ ONGOING: Monitor and Optimize**: Adjust batch sizes and monitor performance

## Production Strategy Summary
- **Phase 1**: Community cleanup (~36K records) - SAFE PILOT
- **Phase 2**: Reading cleanup (~200M records) - MAJOR SPACE SAVINGS  
- **Phase 3**: Tenant cleanup (~11.8M records) - COMPREHENSIVE CLEANUP
- **Expected**: 30-50% database size reduction
